Team Profile Generator
---------------------------------
This is my attempt at creating a team profile generator.
I was pretty dissapointed because I felt I was close to making a breakthrough, but unfortunately I cannot spend anymore time on this project. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea was to creat several JS files for each team member in Lib, so the manager will be able to see each profile and have an option to create one based on the template of each member. In the test folder Credentials.js was suppose to be the first question asked in the CLI whether or not the manager wanted to see the team roster. The index folder was to contain most of the other code for logging in the Manager and pushing the team roster. Sadly I was only able to get the manager's questionaire to work in CLI and then Generate a non-interactable html. I could not get the rest of the features to work, and if not for the sake of time would have gladly finished it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was able to generate an HTML file that fills in the Manager's name, ID, email, and office number all from node.js. All you have to do to test it is run node result.js and it will start the prompt.
